                <p>Under the pillow is a note saying, I’m Astrophel, and you?</p>
<p>I stand beside my bed, feeling confused. Today is Monday, and I am going to have my Math test in the afternoon, which gave me a extremely bad nightmare. I hate tests, and all the subjects. Now the sun is shining, and my sister is striking my door, which irritates me. I have no time to think about it, because it’s time for school.</p>
<p>On the school bus, I just can’t help thinking of the note.</p>
<p>The handwriting is definitely not mine. I prefer to write A in two strokes, but this A is in one stroke. Also, though I don’t want to admit, the handwriting is much better than mine. The note is so clean that if I give it to my mum, she must think I’m not her daughter.</p>
<p>My name is Astrophel, and it’s common to have a same name, but it’s not common to receive a note from a person with the same name and the note is under my pillow. I mean, it can’t be a coincidence. I always lock my door when I’m sleeping, since this can make me feel safety, so I’m sure that nobody can get into my room. I don’t think I would write a note and put it under my pillow.</p>
<p>“That’s strange!” I say to my friend May.<br>
“Yeah...But maybe you have schizo...phoria?”<br>
“It’s schizophrenia.”<br>
“OK, whatever, it is possible.”<br>
“...Fine, but why I changed my handwriting?”<br>
“Oh!” She says in a dramatic way, “that’s not you! That’s another you, another Astrophel!”</p>
<p>Her loud voice makes the teacher in front of us turn back and give us a glance. We shut up and fall into silence.</p>
<p>When I’m a little girl, I hoped for such unusual things which can only be seen in fictions everyday. However, there can’t be another Astrophel, another me, and it’s highly possible that the note is just a joke. Now the math test worries me most, I almost sleep in all the math classes, and now I still can’t figure out sine and cosine correctly. May is also bad at math, but she even doesn’t care about it.</p>
<p>In my uneasiness, the test comes. Tangent, adjacent, radian...</p>
<p>Damn it! I hate math!</p>
<p>I try my best to fill in all the blanks, but in vain. 30minutes later, I give up and begin to write on the scratch paper.</p>
<p>[I hate mathhhhhhhh!]<br>
[Ah, another 0!!]</p>
<p>Then I think back the note.</p>
<p>[Is it a joke?]</p>
<p>To my astonishment, a sentence appears on my scratch paper before I write.</p>
<p>{No, it’s not a joke.}</p>
<p>Wow, am I too sleepy?</p>
<p>[? Who are you?]<br>
{I’m Astrophel, maybe from another world.}<br>
[Really?]</p>
<p>Now I even want to stand up and tell everyone about it.</p>
<p>{I’m not so sure...Anyway, do you need help in math?]<br>
[Yeah! You can help me?]<br>
{Sure, I’m good at it.}<br>
[I love uuuuuuu!!!!!!!]<br>
{It’s an... easy test. I will write process on your paper, since I am having the same test too.}<br>
[So cooooool!!]</p>
<p>Well, she’s really good at it. A multiple choice which I should spend at least 5 minutes to solve, she only needs less than one minute.</p>
<p>[I have fallen in love with you.]<br>
{You are writing on the scratch paper.}<br>
[(´;︵;`)]</p>
<p>The bell rings. Before I turn in the paper, I write one last sentence:</p>
<p>[Can I see you again?]</p>
<p>There is no answer.</p>
<p>All the afternoon I am absent-minded. Her beautiful handwriting keep appearing in my mind. I am so absent that I don’t hear May is calling me.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with you?”<br>
“Nothing...How is your test?”<br>
“As always, what about you?”<br>
“em, maybe just so-so.”</p>
<p>I don’t tell the truth. The secret belongs to the deepest corner of my heart. Though May is one of my best friends, I won’t tell her, or anyone of them, everything. I can’t tell who I can totally believe, so I prefer to keep something in my heart. “Astrophel” is one of them.</p>
<p>When I open my textbook, I see the familiar handwriting again.</p>
<p>{Hi, are you still here?}<br>
[Of course!]<br>
{...Do you have anything to ask me?}<br>
[So many things!!]<br>
{Please:)}<br>
[So, who are you?]<br>
{I’m Astrophel, I am you in another world.}<br>
[Another world?]<br>
{Yes, just like...two parallel lines.}<br>
[And now, they crisscross?]<br>
{Yes, two of us meet each other.}<br>
[You mean...there are many “us” in the universe?]<br>
{I’m not sure, but I think we are not in the same universe.}<br>
[Anyway, nice to meet you, Astrophel.]</p>
<p>I don’t notice my math teacher.<br>
“Maybe the young lady know the answer?”<br>
“Er......”</p>
<p>Damn it, I hate math.</p>
<p>{1/2}</p>
<p>“One over two!”<br>
“Right, but it’s necessary to listen carefully in class.”</p>
<p>[Thank u!]<br>
[I can’t love you too much!!]</p>
<p>I have never had such a good math class. When I have something do not understand, Astrophel will respond quickly to my question on the textbook. I get a totally new feeling, a good feeling.</p>
<p>[Will you go home now?]</p>
<p>After the school ends, I ask her.</p>
<p>{Yes, my sister is waiting for me at home.}<br>
[Wow, you have a sister too?]<br>
{She is an angel as well as a monster.}<br>
[Can’t agree more!]<br>
{Let’s go home now. Maybe your little monster is waiting for you too.}</p>
<p>When I get home, I can’t wait to chat with her. I finish my dinner quickly, and lock myself in my room.</p>
<p>[Hi, Are you here? I have just finished my dinner!]<br>
{I’m here.}</p>
<p>It’s strange that she is always there, like she is for me. Maybe she shares the same time table with me.</p>
<p>[Are you always here?]<br>
{Not exactly, but you can think so.}<br>
[Why?]<br>
{Do you forget? I’m another you, I share the same day with you.}<br>
[Oh, did you eat eggplant for lunch?]<br>
{Never, I never eat eggplant.}<br>
[That’s it!! We are comrades now!!]<br>
{Do you like science?}<br>
[I don’t know...maybe yes,but I’m not good at it.]<br>
{Since you love it, you can do it.}<br>
[Wow, you now are like some successful person in our textbook.]<br>
{Certainly I’m not, you can trust me, or not. I won’t force you, but you should follow what you love, follow your heart.}<br>
[What about you?]<br>
{I like what I’m doing, I love math, I love physics, I love what I love.}<br>
[You are so great, I can’t believe you are me.]<br>
{It’s 7 o’clock, I have to do my homework.}<br>
[OK...I decide to finish my math homework by myself from today.]<br>
{Wish you good luck!}<br>
[Thank you!]<br>
{Bye, thank yourself.}</p>
<p>I close the book. The moon is so bright, and I begin to imagine her. Maybe she likes reading? She has really beautiful handwriting. Dose she like badminton?</p>
<p>I finish my homework really hard. I lack some basic knowledge of them, and I have to go over my textbook repeatedly, that’s quite painful. Anyway, I’m happy, I enjoyed a tired but comfortable night, which I have never had before.</p>
<p>I don’t know when I fell asleep. When I get up, I am sleeping on math book, with a blanket on me. Under my face, Astrophel wrote:</p>
<p>{We may never meet again. Anyway, love what you love. Bye.}</p>
<p>The sun is shining, and I have to go to school. I write back:</p>
<p>[Bye, my Astrophel.]</p>
<hr>
<p>“Hey! Succeed?” A young lady says to the one who is taking off the helmet. The huge machine shines sprays bland blue light.<br>
“Yes...And now I know who talked to me when I was a young girl.”<br>
“Don’t tell me it’s yourself.”<br>
“It was me.”<br>
“How did you feel then?”<br>
“I’m thankful to myself.”</p>
<p>The sun is shining, a beam of light gets into the underground lab through the dormant window. She tries to hold the particles, but the waves just cross her hands.</p>
<p>“I am doing what I love.”</p>
